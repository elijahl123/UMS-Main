                    </h2>
                    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
                        Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy
                        preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
                        this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
                        finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
                        that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
                        tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in
                        a revised version of this privacy notice. <br/>

                        provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to
                        provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the
                        information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g.
                        phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification
                        methods as the circumstances dictate.<br/>

                        identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
                        additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or
                        fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we
